  location: 'Remote / Hybrid / On-site (US-wide)',
  availability:
    'Open to DevOps, platform engineering, and full-stack software engineering roles.',
  summary:
    'Software/platform engineer with a deep DevOps background building automation, delivery pipelines, and scalable runtime platforms. Delivered measurable improvements in release speed, reliability, and developer productivity across cloud-native systems on AWS, Azure, and GCP.',
  intro:
    'Expanding into full-stack product delivery — shipping React/TypeScript frontends and Node.js/Express APIs — while bringing the same operational discipline to application code.',
  about:
    "I work on the parts engineering teams notice most when they break: CI/CD pipelines, cloud environments, release handoffs, and production support. Seven years at Dominion Systems have covered Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Terraform, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and observability tooling (Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana), alongside hands-on AWS infrastructure and database operations. More recently I've been shipping full-stack applications — MERN-stack marketplaces, containerized Rails platforms, and medical imaging systems — closing the loop between deployment automation and the applications running on top of it.",
